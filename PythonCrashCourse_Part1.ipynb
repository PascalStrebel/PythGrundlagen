    "## Why Python?\n",
    "Python is the programming language of choice for many scientists to a large degree because it offers a great deal of power to analyze and model scientific data with relatively little overhead in terms of learning, installation or development time. It is a language you can pick up in a weekend, and use for the rest of one's life.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/) is a great place to start getting a feel for the language. To complement this material, I taught a [Python Short Course](http://www.wag.caltech.edu/home/rpm/python_course/) years ago to a group of computational chemists during a time that I was worried the field was moving too much in the direction of using canned software rather than developing one's own methods. I wanted to focus on what working scientists needed to be more productive: parsing output of other programs, building simple models, experimenting with object oriented programming, extending the language with C, and simple GUIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm trying to do something very similar here, to cut to the chase and focus on what scientists need. In the last year or so, the [IPython Project](http://ipython.org) has put together a notebook interface that I have found incredibly valuable. A large number of people have released very good IPython Notebooks that I have taken a huge amount of pleasure reading through. Some ones that I particularly like include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rob Johansson's [excellent notebooks](http://jrjohansson.github.io/), including [Scientific Computing with Python](https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures) and [Computational Quantum Physics with QuTiP](https://github.com/jrjohansson/qutip-lectures) lectures;\n",
    "* [XKCD style graphs in matplotlib](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/jakevdp.github.com/downloads/notebooks/XKCD_plots.ipynb);\n",
    "* [A collection of Notebooks for using IPython effectively](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/tree/master/examples/notebooks#a-collection-of-notebooks-for-using-ipython-effectively)\n",
    "* [A gallery of interesting IPython Notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)\n",
    "\n",
    "I find IPython notebooks an easy way both to get important work done in my everyday job, as well as to communicate what I've done, how I've done it, and why it matters to my coworkers. I find myself endlessly sweeping the [IPython subreddit](http://ipython.reddit.com) hoping someone will post a new notebook. In the interest of putting more notebooks out into the wild for other people to use and enjoy, I thought I would try to recreate some of what I was trying to get across in the original Python Short Course, updated by 15 years of Python, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, and IPython development, as well as my own experience in using Python almost every day of this time."

    "\n",
    "There are two branches of current releases in Python: the older-syntax Python 2, and the newer-syntax Python 3. This schizophrenia is largely intentional: when it became clear that some non-backwards-compatible changes to the language were necessary, the Python dev-team decided to go through a five-year (or so) transition, during which the new language features would be introduced and the old language was still actively maintained, to make such a transition as easy as possible. We're now (2013) past the halfway point, and, IMHO, at the first time when I'm considering making the change to Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, I'm going to write these notes with Python 2 in mind, since this is the version of the language that I use in my day-to-day job, and am most comfortable with. If these notes are important and are valuable to people, I'll be happy to rewrite the notes using Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, these notes assume you have a Python distribution that includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Python](http://www.python.org) version 2.7;\n",
    "* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org), the core numerical extensions for linear algebra and multidimensional arrays;\n",
    "* [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org), additional libraries for scientific programming;\n",
    "* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sf.net), excellent plotting and graphing libraries;\n",
    "* [IPython](http://ipython.org), with the additional libraries required for the notebook interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good, easy to install option that supports Mac, Windows, and Linux, and that has all of these packages (and much more) is the [Entought Python Distribution](https://www.enthought.com/products/epd), also known as EPD, which appears to be changing its name to Enthought Canopy. Enthought is a commercial company that supports a lot of very good work in scientific Python development and application. You can either purchase a license to use EPD, or there is also a [free version](https://www.enthought.com/products/epd/free/) that you can download and install.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some other alternatives, should you not want to use EPD:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linux** Most distributions have an installation manager. Redhat has yum, Ubuntu has apt-get. To my knowledge, all of these packages should be available through those installers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mac** I use [Macports](http://www.macports.org/), which has up-to-date versions of all of these packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Windows** The [PythonXY](https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/) package has everything you need: install the package, then go to Start > PythonXY > Command Prompts > IPython notebook server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloud** This notebook is currently not running on the [IPython notebook viewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/), but will be shortly, which will allow the notebook to be viewed but not interactively. I'm keeping an eye on [Wakari](http://www.wakari.io), from [Continuum Analytics](http://continuum.io/), which is a cloud-based IPython notebook. Wakari appears to support free accounts as well. Continuum is a company started by some of the core Enthought Numpy/Scipy people focusing on big data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Continuum also supports a bundled, multiplatform Python package called [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/) that I'll also keep an eye on."

    "This is a quick introduction to Python. There are lots of other places to learn the language more thoroughly. I have collected a list of useful links, including ones to other learning resources, at the end of this notebook. If you want a little more depth, [Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/) is a great place to start, as is Zed Shaw's [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/).\n",

There's a good introduction to notebooks [in the IPython notebook documentation](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) that even has a [nice video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6dLGQw9yFQ#!) on how to use the notebooks. You should probably also flip through the [IPython tutorial](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/tutorial.html) in your copious free time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, notebooks have code cells (that are generally followed by result cells) and text cells. The text cells are the stuff that you're reading now. The code cells start with \"In []:\" with some number generally in the brackets. If you put your cursor in the code cell and hit Shift-Enter, the code will run in the Python interpreter and the result will print out in the output cell. You can then change things around and see whether you understand what's going on. If you need to know more, see the [IPython notebook documentation](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) or the [IPython tutorial](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/tutorial.html)."
